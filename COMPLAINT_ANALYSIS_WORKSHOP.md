## 🎯 STEP 1: Workshop Setup & Business Context (3 minutes)

### The Challenge
Your financial institution faces:
- **15-20% complaint-to-churn rate** (industry average)
- **5-10 day complaint resolution time** (too slow for retention)
- **Reactive complaint handling** (problems discovered after damage done)
- **Siloed complaint data** (no integration with customer journey)

### Traditional Approach Problems
```
Monday: Complaint surge occurs
Tuesday: Data team notices in weekly report
Wednesday: Analysis begins (manual Excel work)
Thursday: Insights ready, but customers already churning
Friday: Reactive response - too late for retention
```

### The MCP Solution Promise
**Real-time complaint intelligence in 30 seconds vs 3-5 days**

A: MCP operates within your existing security framework. Data never leaves your Teradata environment. Amazon AgentCore provides enterprise-grade security with audit trails and compliance features.

**Q: "How quickly can we implement this?"**
A: The Complaint Analysis Agent can be deployed in hours, not months. You'll see immediate value from day one.

**Q: "What if our complaint data structure is different?"**
A: The MCP approach is flexible and adapts to your data schema. The agent can be customized for your specific complaint fields and business processes.

**Q: "How do we measure success?"**
